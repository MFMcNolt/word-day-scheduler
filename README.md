# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

My motivation for creating this project was to provide users with an intuitive and interactive tool for managing their daily schedules efficiently. I recognized the need for a user-friendly web-based calendar application that focuses on the typical working hours (9amâ€“5pm) and allows users to save and organize events seamlessly.

I built this project to address the challenges many individuals face in organizing their workday schedules. Our goal was to create a simplified, browser-based calendar that anyone can use to manage their daily tasks effectively.

During the development of this project, I learned the importance of user-centered design and user experience (UX). I gained insights into creating responsive and visually appealing web applications using HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Additionally, I became proficient in handling date and time functionalities, whether using external libraries like Day.js and Bootstrap. This project taught us how to balance functionality with simplicity to create a practical and user-friendly web application.

## Installation

Since this calendar is a web-based calendar there is nothing more then a browser that needs to be available to utilize this properly. 

## Usage
Please see below the best usage for this work day scheduler:

You are able to view today's time and date:
When you open the calendar, it will automatically display today's date and time at the top of the page.

You are able to add in events:
To add an event for a specific hour, locate the time slot within the calendar grid corresponding to the desired time.
Click on the description area for that time slot.
Enter the details of your event or task in the text input field.
Click the "Save" button (represented by a floppy disk icon) to save the event.
Here is a screenshot of a filled in calendar from a completed day:

You are able to edit these events:
If you need to edit or update an event, simply click on the text input field for the event you want to modify.
Make your changes and click the "Save" button to update the event.

The calendar uses color-coding to indicate the status of each time slot:
Past Events: Time slots in the past are grayed out.
Current Event: The current time slot is highlighted in red.
Future Events: Time slots in the future are displayed in green.
This screenshot was taken at 8pm at night on 21st September, so all the timeslots are in the past, represented by the grey colour:

Your events are stored on the page:
Your added events are automatically saved locally within your browser's storage. This means that even if you refresh the page or close the browser, your schedule will be preserved for the day.

You can still remove events:
To remove an event, simply delete the text from the text input field and click the "Save" button. This action will clear the event for that time slot.
